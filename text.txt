This is the first line of the sample text file.
It contains several words, some are longer than others.
We can count the lines and the words in this file.
This line has a word: analysis.
Another line for the project, maybe we can find this word later.
Let's see if we can find specific characters too, like the letter 'e'.
This file has some text data.
We can also calculate the average word length.
Here is a very long word to test the longest word feature: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
And a short word: a.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This is the last line.
